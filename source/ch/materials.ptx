        <li>
          <p>
            Pencils and Erasers. Mistakes happen in math, and trying to correct mistakes made with an ink pen is challenging and creates messy work.

        <li>
          <p>
            A 1-inch, 3-ring binder for organizing your Workbook activities and notes, <em>unless using a digital alternative.</em>

            Graph Paper for notes and assignments. My favorite choice is <url href="https://bookstore.pcc.edu/store4/MerchDetail?MerchID=1621016" visual="https://bookstore.pcc.edu/store4/MerchDetail?MerchID=1621016">Engineering Paper</url>, 
            which is constructed to have faint lines on the front for a clean appearance, but any <url href="https://bookstore.pcc.edu/store4/MerchDetail?MerchID=1415029" visual = "https://bookstore.pcc.edu/store4/MerchDetail?MerchID=1415029">graph paper</url> will do.

			A personal graphing calculator (such as a TI-84+) or Scientific Calculator (such as a TI-30XS) may be helpful for this class but is not required. <em>All quizzes and exams 
			will be done without access to a calculator.</em> Where technology is required in this class, a free online tool such as <url href="https://www.desmos.com">Desmos</url> can be used.
