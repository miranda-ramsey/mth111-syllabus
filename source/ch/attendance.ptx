    <title>Attendance Policy</title>
    <p>
      Attendance and participation are crucial to succeed in a math course. In 
      this class, Group Work will be a large component, so students are 
      expected to attend class and collaborate with each other. Credit for 
      group work will not be given if students are absent or not participating.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I understand that perfect attendance is not a practical 
      expectation. If you must miss class, please email me to let me know, and 
      I will work with you to make sure you keep up and that your grade is 
      minimally affected.
