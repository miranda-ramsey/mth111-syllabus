	  Povides Provides preparation for trigonometry or calculus. Focuses on 
	  functions and their properties, including polynomial, rational, 
	  exponential, logarithmic, piecewise-defined, and inverse functions. 
	  Explores topics symbolically, numerically, and graphically in real-life 
	  applications and interprets them in context. Emphasizes skill building, 
	  problem solving, modeling, reasoning, communication, connections with 
	  other disciplines, and the appropriate use of present-day technology. 
	  This course is part of Oregon Common Course Numbering. MTH 111 and MTH 
	  111Z are equivalent. The PCC Mathematics Department recommends that 
	  students take MTH courses in consecutive terms. Audit available.

      Upon completion of the course students should be able to:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
			  Explore the concept of a function numerically, symbolically, 
			  verbally, and graphically and identify properties of functions 
			  both with and without technology.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
			  Analyze polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic 
			  functions, as well as piecewise-defined functions, in both 
			  algebraic and graphical contexts, and solve equations 
			  involving these function types.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
			  Demonstrate algebraic and graphical competence in the use and 
			  application of functions including notation, evaluation, 
			  domain/range, algebraic operations and composition, inverses, 
			  transformations, symmetry, rate of change, extrema, intercepts, 
			  asymptotes, and other behavior.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
			  Use variables and functions to represent unknown quantities, 
			  create models, find solutions, and communicate an interpretation 
			  of the results.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
			  Determine the reasonableness and implications of mathematical 
			  methods, solutions, and approximations in context.
